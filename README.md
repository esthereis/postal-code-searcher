# API Consumption Project -Postal Code Searcher-Sujeito Programador

This project was created based on a tutorial from the "Sujeito Programador" YouTube channel. The tutorial in question covered the development of a web application using React and JavaScript to consume an API. However, I made a significant modification by selecting an API that is not from Brazil but from the Netherlands.

## Main Modification
The primary modification in this project involves using a Dutch API to demonstrate the functionality of external data consumption. While it was a relatively straightforward change, it is important to note that using this specific API may make the project approximately 2 seconds slower than the API used by the youtuber in Brazil.

## Technologies Used
  React
  JavaScript
